I've submitted two solutions Twitter.zip and TwitterTweet.zip. Both solutions were only able to get 20 tweets. I'm not sure why there is this limitation on both codes.

Twitter.zip (Javascript)
 - I ran this in terminal, so you have to install node ''. Then run 'node get.js'
 -  I had to comment out the sort for urls(line 28-34), because I was only able to get Kanye's first 20 tweets which all contained urls. Ideally the sort should work if there was more tweets.
 - I was not able to make the program repeat the steps as I had trouble making javascript wait before fetching again.

TwitterTweet.zip (Java)
This was my first attempt before I switched to javascript.

I tried using postman to fetch the data which was able to fetch 3200 tweets. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to run the generated code snippets postman, so I used the two ways I explained above.
